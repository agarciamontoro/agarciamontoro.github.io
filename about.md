# Who am I?

I am Alejandro García Montoro, a computer scientist and mathematician from
Granada, Spain. You can follow me on [Github][l_Github],
[Mastodon][l_Mastodon] and [Twitter][l_Twitter]. You can even ping me on [Telegram][l_Telegram] if you want to.

# What am I doing *now*?

I am currently enrolled in the Google Summer of Code program
(GSoC), working for [CERN-HSF][l_CERN] organization in the awesome
[ROOT][l_ROOT] software ---take a look at my project at the
[GSoC site][l_GSoC]---.

# What is this site?

This is my personal site, which is built with Jekyll and based on the awesome [Athena][l_Athena] theme; check its [source code][l_Source] out!

I wanted to set a personal site for some time now, and my participation at GSoC forced me to finally have a space where I could publish a weekly post about my work as a GSoCer. However, this site is thought to be more than that, and I will try to write about all kind of coding stuff, hopefully always from a *feminist*, *anti-capitalist* and *libre* perspective.

# What are those latin words in the footer?

It is thought that *omnia sunt communia* was the battle cry used in the [German Peasants' War][l_revolt] (1525) by Thomas Müntzer and his comrades, who started a peasants' revolution that defied the feudal authorities and their violation of the commons. Although it is unclear that the cry was actually used by the rebels, the revolt did fought the late feudalism and the upcoming capitalism from a grassroots movement, and the meaning of those words do remain intact today: "all things are to be held in common".

I believe *all* knowledge has to be shared, software included, and those three words just capture that idea in a strong powerful way.
